# Student-Faculty-Interaction
The project is designed for reducing the problems that students face in interacting with the professors offline. It provides a platform for students to ask queries related to the subjects they are enrolled in and can provide answers to other queries asked by different students at any point of time. The faculties as well as the students can access the queries and can write answers. It can prove to be a very good platform for the students who are unable to ask doubts in classrooms and can help the students so that they can have an interaction with the faculty whenever they encounter a doubt. Moreover, each faculty member can answer the queries according to their availability.
